QICT: A Pairwise Test Case Generator
====================================

This program originally appeared in the [MSDN Magazine, December
2009](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ee819137.aspx).

I took the code there (assumed to be public domain) and polished it a bit
to add command-line parameters and a few options. The bulk of the algorithm
remains unchanged.

See the comments at the top of Qict.cs for more info.
